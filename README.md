# Togoodtogo notification 

## TL;DR
This simple script helps to get notification from togoodtogo when new offers appears from favorite list.

## Description
Once you have added all the users email in the file `constant.py` the file `get-credentials.py` can be invoked: users credentials will be stored locally.
Then the `main.py` can be scheduled to be executed iteratively, when new offers appears a new task (notification?) can be executed.
