# Togoodtogo notification 

## TL;DR
This simple script helps out you to get notification from togoodtogo when new offers appears from your favorite list.

## Description
Once you have added all the users email in the file constant.py. The file get-credentials.py can be invoked: users credentials are stored locally.
Then the main.py can be scheduled to be executed iteratively, when new offers appears a new task (notification?) can be executed.
